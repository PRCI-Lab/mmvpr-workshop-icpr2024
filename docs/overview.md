The workshop aims to foster collaboration and exchange of ideas among researchers from different domains, including pattern recognition, computer vision, machine learning, signal processing, and artificial intelligence. By addressing technical issues such as feature heterogeneity, data fusion, and cross-modal correlation modeling, the workshop aims to advance the state-of-the-art in multi-modal visual pattern recognition and promote the development of innovative solutions for real-world applications. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:
- Integration of multiple modalities (such as images, videos, text, audio, and other sensor data) for pattern recognition tasks.
- Novel algorithms and techniques for multi-modal feature extraction, representation learning, and fusion.
- Applications of multi-modal visual pattern recognition in various domains, including computer vision, multimedia analysis, biometrics, healthcare, robotics, and more.
- Evaluation methodologies and benchmark datasets for assessing the performance of multi-modal visual pattern recognition systems.

Multi-modal visual pattern recognition has become increasingly important in various domains, including surveillance, robotics, healthcare, and multimedia analysis. The ability to integrate information from multiple modalities enables more robust and comprehensive understanding of complex real-world environments. As such, the workshop on Multi-modal Visual Pattern Recognition with Challenge Tracks is highly relevant and of interest for the community. By incorporating challenge tracks into the workshop, participants will have the opportunity to benchmark their algorithms and techniques against state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal pattern recognition. This not only fosters healthy competition but also encourages the development of novel approaches and solutions to address the challenges in the field. Furthermore, the workshop provides a unique platform for researchers to showcase their work, share insights, and engage in discussions on emerging trends and future directions in multi-modal visual pattern recognition. This platform contains datasets, evaluation metrics, baseline algorithms, and evaluation server.
